      label: Minimal Reproducible Example
      description: >
        When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide code that they can easily understand and use to **reproduce** the problem. This is referred to by community members as creating a [minimal reproducible example](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/minimum-reproducible-example/).
      placeholder: |
        ```rust
        // Code to reproduce your issue here
        use ultralytics_template_rust::add_numbers;

        fn main() {
            let result = add_numbers(1, 2);
            println!("Result: {result}");
        }
        ```
